		 I created this information packed poster using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe InDesign. I wanted to create something that was functional yet aesthetically pleasing and easy to understand. I handchose and licensed each icon to match the content of the poster, and again chose earthy green tones that blend well with the subject matter.
