		Meet Akeem Caine, a 29-year-old native New Yorker who works at a Brooklyn law firm by day while building his own plant consulting business on the side. “I hope one day it’ll turn into a full-time gig, I’m taking plant courses right now to learn more about specific species and the environments they thrive in,” says Akeem. He noticed how often he would get texts from friends and Instagram DM’s from strangers asking him for tips on taking care of their plants. “People send me photos of their plants all the time like, ‘Akeem! What do I do?’ and I’m like, honey, your baby is so sunburnt - try moving it out of direct sunlight and buy a self-watering pot.” Akeem’s advice has proved beneficial for many, and now he wants to offer those services as a structured business. His plant consulting business plans to help customers source the best plants for their spaces, given the environment of the customer’s home and the look they're going for. Akeem’s collaborative business spans far beyond his eye for design by offering help with upkeep and maintenance as well.
