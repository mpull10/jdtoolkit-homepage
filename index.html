		Scattered throughout cities across the globe, behind the towering walls of cement, surrounded by buildings, many may find a small oasis, a personal garden, pothos leaves crawling up the walls, and trailing stems around tables. Over the course of the last 9 months, city dwellers have polished off their green thumbs and saturated their apartments with a curated selection of home plants. Stemming from social media movements to a need for company, we spoke to some current plant owners about their new found green roommates during quarantine.

		House plants have been around long before Covid-19 but for many, long term confinement has been a proactive incentive for many to fill their homes with new life. Whether living home alone or needing to spruce up a common space, quarantine has opened doors for new alternatives to connect with nature. Additionally, with an increase in free time, social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and Pinterest, have been the main tool for sharing all things plant related. People are now dedicating their newfound free time to creating new lush gardens in their homes, all the while subsequently caring for themselves. While not everyone has been as successful with their new plants, creators across a multitude of platforms such as TikTok, and local nurseries are extending their knowledge to help new plant parents. Whether stemming from social media movements to a need for company, we spoke to current plant owners about their newfound green roommates during quarantine and their plant careers.

		Plants have provided many with their moments of peace in a chaotic world. It was the serenity of Sunday morning plant watering routine, the Wednesday afternoon walk to your local nursery and the Monday evenings of filming new plant TikTok’s. Whatever it may have been, it was unifying. It was a moment of clarity and peace. A moment to forget what was happening around you and care for the green sprout in your living room. It was a moment to appreciate the present and the future. Imagine what the baby Monstera plant you bought this month will look like this time next year. Imagine what the world will look like this time next year.
